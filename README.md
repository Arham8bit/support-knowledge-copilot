## 📖 Overview

Support Knowledge Copilot is a production-ready RAG API that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask natural language questions about them.

Instead of relying solely on semantic search, this project combines **dense retrieval (embeddings)** and **sparse retrieval (BM25)** using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** to improve retrieval quality. Responses are generated using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** and include **page-level citations** so every answer can be verified.

# 💬 Example

### Request

```http
POST /query
```

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the state vector?"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the state vector?",
  "answer": "The objective of defining a complete system state is to estimate the motion of an object moving in three-dimensional space (Source: doc1.pdf, Page: 5).",
  "sources": [
    {
      "source": "doc1.pdf",
      "page": 5
    },
    {
      "source": "doc1.pdf",
      "page": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

# ❓ Why Hybrid Retrieval?

Most introductory RAG projects rely solely on vector search. This project instead combines two complementary retrieval techniques.

### Semantic Search

Uses embeddings to retrieve text with similar meaning.

Example:

> "I forgot my login"

can successfully retrieve

> "Reset your password"

even though the wording is different.

---

### BM25 Keyword Search

Finds exact keyword matches.

Useful for questions such as:

* Equation 15
* Error Code 500
* API Key
* Configuration File

where semantic embeddings often perform poorly.

---

### Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Instead of combining incompatible similarity scores, RRF merges the ranked retrieval lists based solely on their positions.

This avoids score normalization issues while improving recall.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arham8bit/support-knowledge-copilot.git

cd support-knowledge-copilot
```

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Mac/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your Google AI Studio API key.

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## 5. Add PDF Documents

Place your PDF files inside

```text
data/raw/
```

---

## 6. Build the Vector Index

```bash
python scripts/ingest.py
```

The ingestion pipeline:

* extracts text
* cleans documents
* creates chunks
* generates embeddings
* stores vectors in ChromaDB

Existing documents are skipped automatically.

---

## 7. Start the API

```bash
uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload
```

---

## 8. Open Interactive API Docs

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

# 📡 API

## POST `/query`

Ask questions about your documents.

### Request

```json
{
  "question":"your question"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "question":"your question",
  "answer":"Grounded answer with citations",
  "sources":[
      {
         "source":"document.pdf",
         "page":5
      }
  ]
}
```

---

## GET `/health`

Returns server status.

```json
{
  "status":"healthy",
  "chunks_indexed":215
}
```

---

## GET `/`

Displays available API endpoints.

---

# 🧪 Running Tests

# ⚙ Engineering Decisions

<details>

<summary><strong>Why not use LangChain's built-in RAG chain?</strong></summary>

Instead of relying entirely on LangChain abstractions, the embedding pipeline was implemented manually to gain experience with batching, retry logic, metadata preservation, and debugging production issues.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why chunk at 800 characters with 100-character overlap?</strong></summary>

Chunk overlap prevents important information from being split across chunk boundaries. A chunk size of 800 characters preserves semantic context while remaining focused enough for accurate retrieval.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why Reciprocal Rank Fusion?</strong></summary>

Semantic similarity scores and BM25 scores are measured on different scales. RRF combines retrieval results using rank positions instead of raw scores, making it robust without requiring score normalization.

</details>

# 🚧 Future Improvements

* Cross-Encoder Re-ranking
* OCR Support
* Docker Deployment
